# Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Pick a random card and let it face up. Guess weather the next card on the top of the deck is higher or lower than the randomly picked card. Get 100 point for correct guess, and lose 75 point for a wrong guess 

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
